# YourTab

Originally forked from Greduan's [Tabulator](https://github.com/Greduan/chrome-ext-tabulator). There has been a lot of modifications ever since.

Started as a OneTab open source clone, but more features are getting added in!

A Chrome extension that keeps tabs on your tabs. Whenever you have too many tabs, put all of them on YourTab with a click and access them later!

# Current Features:
--* Save All Tabs in a click, or choose the ones you want to save!
--* Name your Tab Groups and drag and drop stuff into them next time!
--* Option to use Alt + Q to Save the current Tab
