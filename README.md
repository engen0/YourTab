# YourTab

Originally forked from Greduan's [Tabulator](https://github.com/Greduan/chrome-ext-tabulator). There has been a lot of modifications ever since.

A Chrome extension that keeps tabs on your tabs. Whenever you have too many tabs, put all of them on YourTab with a click and access them later!

Started as a OneTab open source clone, but more features are getting added in!
