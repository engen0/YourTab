# The Tab

Originally forked from Greduan's [Tabulator](https://github.com/Greduan/chrome-ext-tabulator), but modified it so much I decided to rehost it in a new repo.

A Chrome extension that keeps tabs on your tabs. Whenever you have too many tabs, put all of them on The Tab with a click and access them later!

Started as a OneTab open source clone, but more features are getting added in!
